            <h1>THE STORY OF A PHOTOGRAPHER</h1>
            <p>My name is Ashley Granger, and I am a photographer out of Columbus, Ohio. While I love capturing the views of the city, I also have been able to capture the beauty of parts of Italy and Greece. I even have some trips planned during the winter months, for which I am very excited for.</p>
            <p>Photography was not my first choice as a career, but after I graduated college, I began taking pictures for my brother's baseball team, and I realized that I had found a new passion and career goal in my life. I am still new to this world but am very grateful for the people and places I have been able to capture thus far.</p>
            <p>If you enjoy my work and would like to work with me, please push the contact button or message me on <a className="insta" href="http://instagram.com/_u/ashley.g.photos/">Instagram!</a> Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
